# Simple-Encryption-and-Decryption-program-in-python
A simple encrypt decrypt program in python which is further developement of the Caesar Cipher.The program works on two phases encrypt and
decrypt


## Modules required
-> caesar cipher 


#Encryption Processes
Step 1: Takes text to encrypt as input
Step 2: Takes the Key
Step 3: Returns Caesar Cipher
Step 4: Converts Caesar cipher to hexvalue
Step 5: Converts the hex value into 8 bit binary
Step 6: Use of XOR gate between binary key and cipher binary
Step 7: The binary converted to hexa value
Step 8: Hexa value is replaced by corrsponding ASCII character
Step 9: Output of inputted text


# Decryption processes

Decryption works opposite of encryption
